# React/Apollo/Redux Boilerplate

## Setting up

Before you start, make sure you have a working [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) environment (this project was built using Node >7.0.0).

Preferably use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of NPM.

From the project folder, execute one of the following commands to install the project's dependencies.

```shell
npm install
```

Or if you are using Yarn, execute this command instead:

```shell
yarn
```

To run the app execute the following command:

```shell
npm start
```

This command will kick off a Webpack build of the project and watch your files for changes. When the build is finished, you can open the app at http://localhost:9000.
